### Features

* `ServerConfig` now accepts a bundles directory instead of bundle paths (deprecated) so the server can support dynamic bundle names (ie. when you generate a hash as part of the bundle name for cache busting) ([f3d7cef](https://github.com/proteinjs/server/commit/f3d7cefd58cb0b220470e886e161fbc028ca2df9))
